mail reader/composer that uses an SQL database to store mail. Several frontends,
including gtk+, gnome, curses, java, possibly perl cgi or php. Will support
threading, searching, archiving, accurate parsing, accurate mail contruction,
smtp, sendmail, maybe pop3 and imap down the road.

Backend will be the SQL database (mysql and postgres will be tested).
Frontends will be the bulk of the work.

milestones:
	tables: figure out what tables there will be and their schema
	utils: small programs to translate between mh and the db (IE, a utility
		to move a spool into the tables, and a utility to move the
		tables into a mail spool)
	java swing FE: simple graphical interface to start working out UI 
		details.
	java CLI FE: figure out how to do it without pictures and clicking
	gnome FE: for me to use.
	gtk+ FE: backport of gnome.
	curses FE: for when I telnet in
	web interface: for losers :)

why? jeff waddell said something about integrating sql support into pine. I've
been looking for a good mail reader/composer and have been using xfmail (I've 
already tried pine and mutt, tyvm), and it craps out with like 10,000 emails
in a folder. It also craps out on mh archives, misinterpretting the 'From' in
some dumbasses responses. Instead of learning xfmail and fixing it, I figured
I'd start my own and use sql to handle the ugly stuff :)
