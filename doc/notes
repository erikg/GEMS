Yes.

When manipulating mail spools, you should generally use both a
lockfile and fcntl().

To create a lockfile, create a file in the spool directory, link() it
to <username>.lock, and unlink() the original. This is the only method 
which is reliable over NFS.

As a shortcut, you can use the `lockfile' program which is supplied
with procmail.
