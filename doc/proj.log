Jan 23, 2000:
	started
	researched spool format, RFC: 821 822 974 1123 1425 1651 1869
	Designed tables
	Built crude spool reader, splits emails correctly
	Built linked list object, for reading files in without truncating or
		running the system out of memory
	Installed mysql shtuff to learn later :)
	Blew up my mail spool, going to start using a dummy account to test on
	made a 'message' struct, finally got things being pushed into it right
	it connects and disconnects from the db correctly
	spool2sql inserts about half the info
	showmail correctly shows all info (parsing is correct) :)
	made a util to flush the tables (cleanup between trial runs)
	~10000 emails takes 30 seconds processor time on my cyrix 120 to parse

	root@fenris /home/devel/mail# cat *.[ch] | wc -l
	    586

Jan 24, 2000:
	added 'stringinate', it now dumps 'header' and 'body' fields in :)
	fixed a segfault occurring in hefty parses
	fixed memory oops when dealing with massive emails
	lots of heavy testing (12,000 emails, 45 megs...)

Jan 25, 2000:
	celebrated my fiances b-day :)
	fixed a bug where a few subjects, headers, and a lot of bodies were NOT
		making it into the db, had to add the escape shtuff
	more heavy testing
	
	712 lines
Jan 26/27, 2000:
	explored 'glade' some, experimented with a few looks

Jan 28, 2000:
	started on the java swing FE

Jan 31, 2000:
	over the last few days, I played with glade and mysql some.
	To use a tool like glade, a thorough UI spec should exist... :/
	MySQL lacks some critical features, like subselects.
	Postgresql supports 'large objects' as well as subselects, which means
		it'd be a better choice. Must now convert my utils to postgres

Feb 05, 2000:
	added another table, tried to adjust the java to handle it

Feb 06, 2000:
	woke up and sed (my betta) was dead :(
	redid the tables
	updated the utils and java to match
	lots of bugfixes and work in utils to make 'em robust/correct
	lots of work on tricky date handling in headers

Feb 08, 2000:
	did some changing to the tables and the utils, now stored 'reference'
	profiling on the utils, I think malloc() is my bottleneck
	scrapping the java cli project and stopping the java gui project.
	restructured directories
	set up automake/autoconf/libtool shtuff
	some abuse with lint, I'd like to have everything lint clean...

Feb 10, 2000:
	still fighting automake/autoconf... 
	now planning on making dbi's and ui's as .so plugins

Feb 15, 2000:
	spent the last few days making a 'shell', converting to the .so plugins,
		and setting up a pref file "~/.bmailrc"
Feb 19, 2000:
	still struggling with the library faces :/ GTK loads, GNOME won't
	got gnome fixed, was a link time oops that didn't produce an error...
	got the face talking to the dbi, very cool
	realized the mysql dbi is incomplete, gotta trim up on that
	trying to figure out how to use glade produced source...

Feb 20-24, 2000:
	a lot of work on the shell procedure, passing stuff to the faces
	updated all the faces for the new shell procedure :)
	bugfixes all over the common stuff and dbi, spool2sql works again
	lots of glade work for gnome, and lots of gluing the pieces together
	pulls 1000 emails really fast ...
	hacked the glade xml file to allow the control I need. I should talk
		to the glade folks about making a 'workspace' where UI's can
		be put together without needing a window. :/
	
Feb 27:
	started on the second GNOME ui, GNOME_o. Kinda outlookish, it's ugly
		but it's internally much simpler than GNOME_e.

Feb 29:
	been fighting ctree's.
	lots of small details being plugged in, becoming a fairly capable reader	column sorting
	'prev/next' buttons and keys
	up/down controls mapped to body

Mar 1 - Mar 11:
	way past deadlines. Made up a sheet of todo's.
	Fought long and hard with an alternative LL implementation, and threw
		it away. :/ Fixed the current one.
	Major bughunt went on
	Lots of memleak fixes. Sucked in a 65 meg spool without leaking :)

Mar 12:
	DB normalization and message threading :)
	added the compose window, popup menu for mboxes, couple dialog boxes
	working at plugging the buttons into the right actions

Mar 13:

Mar 19:
	got the regex rules working, nifty

Mar 20:
	added create/delete mbox capabilities, all plugged in.
Mar 21:
	added preferences to the db
	GNOME_o loads preferences
	GNOME_o saves preferences automagically :)
Mar 29:
	been working on the rules
	started manual today

May 13:
	back on the project. Between the manual and school, had no time.
	picked up on the rules, GNOME likes rules now, spool2sql likes 'em, too
	got a new betta a while back. This one's white, and seems tamer. My
	  plocastymous (awk) isn't taking shit from him. His working name is
	  424317, until I figure out a good name :) I got a new fishie, I got
	  my angel, I got a new amp in my truck, life is good :) If only I had
	  a job that didn't pay pittance...
	database normalization takes too long with lots of email in the db

May 15:
	took my statistics final today... that's it for math. :)
	the big bottleneck is ll_addnode() still (profiled it)
	fixed a date oops (had to do with case sensitivity)
	lint is being problematic. sweet tool, tho

May 23:
	adjusted tables to mark the emails 'status' (read, unread, marked, ...)
	mailbox list now has several automatic sub-boxes, per status
	status is correctly handled by mboxes
	messages are automatically marked 'read' when read (therefore moved)
	drafted a hefty TODO list.
May 24:
	Changed gtk_widget_show() to gtk_widget_realize() so it starts cleaner
	mboxs now knows how many unread messages are in a mailbox
	mboxes with unread messages are displayed in a different color

May 28:
	found reason for segfault on exit, commented out line in shell.c

May 30:
	modified spool read so it doesn't lose info
	cleaned up normalization some... needs more work. Especially efficiency
	created normalization face
	tested with 150 megs of spool...

May 31:
	rebuilt for profiling, running some big spools thru...

Aug27:
	ahhh, the joy of neglect :) Some minor bug fixes in the face
	here's a quick todo list
		* smtp transmitter
		* local spool receiver
		* pop3 receiver
		* mime
	Everything is now called 'gems'. s/bmail/gems/ everywhere
